## Notes and Reminders ##
* Create your scratchpads in scripts/scratchpads/
* Don't forget to pull before working
* Download the autoDocstring extension for VS Code, and use (CMD/CTRL) + SHIFT + 2 to generate a docstring for a function automatically
* Run the hook folder config command in the instructions

## Instructions ##

### Create a virtual environment in the repository folder ###
  * Create a folder ".venv" in the repository, then cd into it
  * Create the environment
      * On Windows (Git Bash): "python -m venv (your environment name here)"
      * On macOS: "python3 -m venv (your environment name here)"
  * Activate the environment
      * Run the command "source (environment name)/bin/activate"
        * If inside the repository folder instead of .venv/ run "source .venv/(environment name)/bin/activate"
### Install the project as a local package ###
  * Make sure your terminal/CMD's working directory is the algo-playground folder
  * Install the current project as a package with pip **(don't forget the period in the command at the end)**
      * On Windows: "python -m pip install -e ."
      * On macOS: "python3 -m pip install -e ."
  * To update dependencies later down the line, re-install the package locally as above
### Use the tracked git hooks folder instead of your local copy for necessary hooks ###
  * From the algo-playground directory, run "git config core.hooksPath hooks"
### [Create an Alpaca account](https://app.alpaca.markets/signup) ###
  * Once the account is created, switch your view (top left corner) to the paper trading dashboard instead of live.
  * On the right hand side, click "show" on "Your API keys"
  * Make a copy of the file "alpaca.config.example" from main repository folder and rename it to "alpaca.config"
      * Note that "alpaca.config" is in the .gitignore so your file with your keys should not be committed with the rest of your work. The filename should be greyed out in VS Code
  * Open the new "alpaca.config" file and copy/paste your API key ID and secret key inside of the quotations that say "paste here"
  * Run the python script "scratchpad_example.py" inside of the tests folder, and it should print out your account information without any errors
### Building the documentation ###
  * Happens automatically when a push occurs
  * Can be triggered manually while current working directory in terminal is algo-playground/docs/
      * On Windows (Git Bash), run
          * python generate_source_rst.py
          * mingw32-make html
      * On macOS, run
          * python3 generate_source_rst.py
          * make html
  * Open "docs/index.html" with your browser. Enjoy! You can even bookmark it
